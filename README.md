```
My model is the server.js file: it's a very easy model with hard coded data. But you get the idea.

steps:
1. install server packages
2. install frontend / client side packages
3. run "npm run dev"

# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for frontend
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run frontend

# Server runs on http://localhost:8080 and client on http://localhost:3000
```
